title: Month in Review - August 2014
date: 31/08/2014

I can't believe we're through with August now.

I'd say that August was a month of change
for me this year. I've made a lot of good
(and bad!) decisions, which will echo into
the months ahead. Overall, though, it was
a decently productive month for me.

#### Some Things of Note Which Happened in this Month ####

* Mikaela and I shared a formal date:
For dinner, we went to [A La Maison][alamaison].
We also made a commitment to try
to make long distance work while she's at school.

* A local band, "[Short Lived Affair][sla]", broke up.
They played a great last show, and I will miss
their music now... They were a great rock band.

* My Sunday and Thursday [campaigns][prd] are both
on hold for now due to everyone's life
being too full for such a committment.

* I learned to play [horse shoes][horseshoes] at a picnic.

* [Skype][skype] rolled out a release which makes [linux][linux]
users install [pulseaudio][pulse]. For me,
this meant I won't be using [Skype][skype]. Instead,
I've switched to [Hangouts][hangouts] by [Google][google] and so,
I've now become more insterested in [Plus][plus].


#### Some Things I Have Accomplished in this Month ####

* For One, I started writing posts on this
website, [Tumbling Owl][tumblingowl]. I haven't missed
a single day so far, either. I'm proud.

* I started [Laurel Lee][laurellee], my first album
of harp music. It should be out this year.

* I chose to start to [exercise][workout] again,
and have begun to follow that program.

* I played an open mic nearby my house:
[Space Plague][spaceplague] was hosting, and I played my harp.

* And [Ruby][ruby] became something that I like
to work using. This site was built with it.

#### Looking at September ####

My final thoughts about August: It was
a lot of fun, even when it was hard.
I got a lot of things started and now,
as I move on to September, I am
excited to see how they all come out.

I'll see You then. Until that time, take care.
