title: Headaches and Asthma
date: 23/08/2014

It's hard to say when I first felt a pain
behind my eyes, especially my left.

Before You ask, I did see a doctor
about my head before. They said it was
my eyes: Astigmatism. I needed
glasses. I wasn't too displeased at this.

See, when I was quite young I found myself
enamoured by the look of wearing glass.
I thought spectacles lent a certain charm
to all who wore them. One I wanted. But...

Alas, my eyes were simply too aligned.
With 20/20 vision I'd not need
to wear glasses until I was quite old.

For a small time, I was upset at this.

But when I got my glasses, I found that
they did not help as much as they should have.
My headaches did not cease, nor could I say
that I could see clearer than I would have
without them on. Also, I was older...
and thus, the cosmetic effects were moot
compared to the hassle of wearing them.

Asthma was a completely different case.

In Sophmore year of high school I nearly
passed out one day in the middle of school.
I had to be wheeled out to my grandma's car,
and taken to the doctor right away.
From there, I almost needed to be swept
away to the hospital, because I
was not responding to the treatments yet.

At last, though, I could breathe deeply again.

They gave me drugs to use to keep in health:
Albuterol Sulfate for treatments that
I was to take as needed. And in case
I wasn't home, they gave me inhalers
containing quicker doses for safety.

But lately I have been thinking about
how my asthma and eyes both aren't improved.
And though I can say that I get through life,
I think I soon will want to get some help.

So I've decided that I need a to find
a doctor near my new apartment. But
I'm hesitant to commit to someone
I do not know. I'll keep You all posted.
