title: Daily Goals
date: 22/08/2014

Each day there are some things I'd like to do
and some which, now, are better off not done.

The word habit is strong. Too strong for me
to use when living life is on the line.
My days should be a string of choices made
from conscious thought, not just twitchy reflex.
Instead I like to call such things my _goals_.

I woke up with a bad headache today.

In lieu of something more complex to write,
I thought I would affirm my newfound goals.
I like having a place to look back on
when things are rough or haven't gone as planned.
It lets me start succeeding once again
instead of tacitly resigning to
giving up on how I want to live.

My goals right now are simple choices that
will help me to succeed more in my life.
As an example one is just to *sleep
for more than seven hours* every night.
I've always had some trouble getting sleep
and so I think this will be a good change.

It also will help me align my days
with my girlfriend's. She studies in Vermont
starting next month, and so will be changing
her sleep schedule. While I cannot awake
at six each day, perhaps I could start to
wake up at eight or nine instead of noon.
I will just need to go to bed a bit
earlier than I have been as of late.

Another goal I have is to *work on
my music* each day. I've let my life become
the focal point instead of my music...
I mustn't cast my life aside, although
I need to find a balance for my trade.
If I can eke out *two hours each day*,
I think I will improve my skills a lot.

My final goal is to *post to my blog*
each day that I can get to my laptop.
I want there to be very few days where
I don't take time to reflect on my work.
It will help me improve my daily grind,
and hopefully will make me do productive work
instead of spiralling out of control.

It also lets me share my work with friends.
So that, too, is a benefit for me.
