title: Calea Victoriei
date: 26/08/2014

As I've begun to make my first record
(with my new [Xenyx][xenyx] now fully set up),
I found time to look back on all my work
from the past year. It's weird, to see my past
spread out before me now. Remembering
each piece, and when I'd been composing it.

So yesterday I began learning this
old piece on my lever harp. Actually,
this is one of my newer ones. Only
a few weeks old. When I began to play
this on my harp, I noticed that I'd made
some compositional choices that were
not really in the interest of the harp.

I've since begun revising it to work,
as it will be on my first album soon.

This is a piece I'm not too displeased with
because it sounds fairly stable and wrought
from the same iron as many of the
old pieces that I play from repertoire.
I am hopeful that I can make it work,
and will include it on my first album.
