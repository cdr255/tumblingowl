title: Troubleshooting and Design
date: 21/08/2014

I went to sleep last night knowing that when
I woke I would promptly begin to work
on this website again. My goal is to,
at least once every day, post something here
about the things I make or do or think.
I want to look back here next August and
without question know I worked hard this year.

And yes, setting up this website was work.

I ended up spending about a day
configuring all of the different parts
of my current set up. But that will be
another post. Today I want to talk
about what I spent my morning doing:
Designing how [toto][toto] would look for You.

[Toto][toto] is a simple blog engine that
was built on top of many other tools
which I use in my day to day work life.
Each post (including this one) is just text,
and written in [Markdown][markdown] (which I adore
using for any kind of text content).
What sets [toto][toto] apart from what I've used
is that it doesn't process all my files-
at least not beforehand. I haven't used
a dynamic blog since I left [Wordpress][wordpress]
back in high school when I got fed up
with all the lag that came from non-static
engines.

[Toto][toto] seems not to have any lag (yet).

So I woke up and went to work post haste:
I knew I had a mascot readymade
from past attempts to launch a static blog.
Her name is Phoebe and she is an owl,
who just can't seem to keep herself upright.
She likes to roll away, a _tumbling owl_.

The template [dorothy][dorothy] ([toto's][toto] best friend)
was very simple and needed some work
for me to use- but as a base, it worked
as intended. One gripe I've had with past
attempts at this is that the default look
of an engine is hard for me to change:
If I wanted to rewrite it from scratch
I would just make my own website to start
with! But, I had no problems doing so
when I began to work on [dorothy][dorothy].

All in all, [toto][toto] has impressed me-
from its light size, to its simple design.
I stopped blogging because I was fed up
with all the bullshit that kept coming up
when I tried to maintain a constant stream
of content. Now, I think that because it's
just text that I need write and add to git
I shouldn't have any stupid bullshit
get in the way of me publishing it.
