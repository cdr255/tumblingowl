I used to buy domains from moniker,
but recently they redesigned their site...
and I cannot (will not) adjust to it.

Of course, with this new blog, I needed to
make changes to enable it to have
its own domain (herokuapp is fine,
but I prefer a root domain. So I
began to look for a new registrar.

It's there that I found [Gandi SAS][gandi].

Parisian in location, they have been
around since the turn of the century.
They're fairly popular, 25th in
the terms of registered domains, and so
I feel confident in trusting them.
They have very little bullshit to wade
through as You do Your work (in fact, that is
their main trademark- "No bullshit." I like that.

What I like more, though, is their use of [FLOSS][floss]
in their service. They also advocate for it,
supporting both the [EFF][eff] and the
[Creative Commons][cc] (which I like a lot).

They even have a [github repo][gandigit] for
their software. That is a great thing; I wish
others would do the same. Imagine if
we could study and learn from every piece
of software on the net. But I digress.

My one and only gripe with them has been
their lack of support for ANAME records.
I've had to 302 the traffic from
my bare domain to the main subdomain.
It's not a big deal but it exists
as the only mark on a perfect list
of features and easy to use UI.

I recommend them if You need domains.
