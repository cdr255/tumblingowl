title: Lilypond Banjo Template
date: 03/09/2014

I have a headache once again today.

Instead of making rambling remarks here,
about the work I'm doing all today,
I want to share something I have just made.

As I am teaching banjo more and more,
I've found a few shortcuts in [lilypond][lilypond]
(Which I have talked about [before][lilypost] on here)
It's mostly little snippets which allow
The making of a properly formed sheet
of music and of tablature for me.

The template is uploaded [here][template], as a
lone [lilypond][lilypond] file for You to use.

Enjoy and let me know how You find it!

[lilypond]: http://lilypond.org/ "Lilypond is how I write my sheet music."
[lilypost]: http://www.tumblingowl.com/2014/08/29/lilypond---how-i-write-music/ "It's a quick little post which explains why I like it for this."
[template]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tumblingowl/lilypond/banjo-template.ly  "Feel free to use this in Your own work, just put the music in the file."
