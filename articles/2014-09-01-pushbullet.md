My friends all know that I am not one to
respond to SMS very quickly.

A large part of the reason is that I
do much of my work on computers and
do not keep a tight grip upon my phone
(or even on its meager battery!)

So when I saw the [PushBullet][pushbullet] service,
I knew I had to try it out today.

I'm very impressed with it so far. I
have wanted something that would let me use
my android phone to text from in Linux
for quite some time. It lets me use the tool
which I prefer (a keyboard, not a screen)
to SMS my friends who prefer that.

Don't get me wrong; it's still a new project.
Because of that, it has a few quirks still.
Sending a message to a phone is hard,
unless they have just sent something to You
(or have made a [PushBullet][pushbullet] account).

But it does work, and I support its growth.
So check it out today, it is all free.
