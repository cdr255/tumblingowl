I work out by myself: I jog a lot,
and love my runs, but I also want more.

Eight months ago I vowed to add some strength
and skill based exercise to my routine.
I started with some failed dumbbell stuff:
Both price and range of motion didn't work
for my current work out. So I being
a nerd went to [Reddit][reddit].

I will be truthful: Pull ups I've slacked on.
I'm heavier than many, so I need
to work on them, but I don't have a bar.
(I also like to make excuses but
I won't go into that matter today.)

But I want to look into something else.
A core point to that work out is the [L
sit][lsit]. Aside from Pull ups, that is the
most difficult facet of my routine.
In fact, I cannot do them well at all.

One way to obtain skill at it is to
use [Parallettes][parallettes]. But I think I will
[construct my own][instr] instead of buying some.

I'll let You all know how it goes when done!
