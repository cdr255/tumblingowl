title: 52 books for 2015
date: 28/12/2014

Here, I wanna outline my details for one of the challenges I am
undertaking next year: The 52 book challenge.

Basically, the idea is to average at least one book a week over the
course of the year. There is a [thriving community][reddit]
surrounding it on Reddit, and plenty of info and support. But I want
to add a little something more.

I am mostly going to be reading E-Books (in [EPUB][epub] format, ftw)
because that is mostly what I have. But I want to come up with
categories to force myself to read diverse works, instead of just
reading 52 long-ish fantasy/sci-fi novels. So, in this post, that is
what I am going to do.

Here we go!

### Genres ###

1. Fantasy Novel
2. Sci-Fi Novel
3. Memoir
4. Biography
5. Instructive
6. Philosophical
7. History
8. Classic
9. Historical Fiction
10. Generic Fiction
11. Criticism
12. Mystery
13. Spiritual

### Cultures ###

1. Beats
2. Counter Culture
3. European
4. Asian
5. African
6. South American
7. Australian
8. Russian
9. Fringe
10. Primitivist
11. Political
12. Motivational
13. Bestseller

If I can hit these 26 categories in the year, I will be happy. I'm
leaving it at 26 because I want to be able to read books I simply want
to read, as well.

I have fallen out of reading, for the most part. Especially due to my
frequent [headaches][headaches], which are something I am addressing in the new
year. Hopefully this list (and this challenge) will help me to
re-mount that horse.

[epub]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB "This is the only format people should publish E-books in."
