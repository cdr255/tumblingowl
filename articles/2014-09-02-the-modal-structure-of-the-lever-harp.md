title: The Modal Structure of the Lever Harp
date: 02/09/2014
description: A brief discussion on the Lever Harp and various ways to increase and expand its harmonic range.

When I begin to try to learn a piece, the first
step is to figure out which key it's in.

It's largely due (in my opinion) to
my lever harp: Its range is kind of small
(at least for modern instruments, I've found).

A "standard tuning" for the lever harp
(in Irish Music, anyway) is that
of E&#x266d; Major, with all levers down.
This lets You use the modes in [this table][table].

A&#x266d;, D&#x266d;, F&#x266f; and B Major
are all beyond my reach with this tuning
(along with many of the minor scales).
I get around songs modulating by
a flip of a lever, or a modal
arrangement of my levers. It's not hard,
but when compared to something like guitar
it is not just a change of frets or strings.

This limitation makes me think a lot
about the underlying harmonies
of any piece I play. And I would say
that it has forced me to become more versed
in modal theory than I would have been.

It also bettered my arrangment skills,
which I use every day to learn pieces.
So I am very thankful that it's so.
