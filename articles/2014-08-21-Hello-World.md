I sit here in the cold and windy room
where I have worked for the past several hours
on setting up this new website. A Blog!
So simple of a concept and yet I've learned
so much within these past four hours. Let's see...

The engine I am using is called [toto][toto].
It uses [Git][git] and lives on [heroku][heroku].
I host pictures on [Amazon S3][aws],
which lets me keep them safely in one place
while making my blog faster than it was.

This was a lot for me to learn so fast;
I was not used to anything but Git
before starting to work on this project.
I feel as though it was all time well spent,
though I admit I wish I were asleep.
