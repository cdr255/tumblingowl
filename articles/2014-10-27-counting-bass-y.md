Returning from my second trip to see
Mikaela at her school up in Vermont,
I've noticed two new things about myself.

The first: How much enjoyment I can have
from hearing and (I hope) from playing Jazz.
Amusingly, I've not before explored
much Jazz because I don't have any friends
who listen to it regularly. It's hard
for me to get into something as wide
as Jazz when there is no one I can talk
about it with.

But now, I'm trading albums every week
between Mikaela and myself. And so,
I'm hearing lots of brand new music.

I'll post some more about this in a bit.
