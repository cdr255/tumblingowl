title: Trip up to Marlboro
date: 04/09/2014

Today I made the ride up to Vermont,
To visit with Mikaela for a week.

While it was quite a long and dragging trip,
I did enjoy the sights (and solitude!).
Some time alone every so often is
a pleasure which I treasure (when I can!).

It took me seven hours to get here.

This is the longest time I've spent away
from family and friends. It's something that's
long overdue for me. I tend to stay
so static that I fall into a rut...
And then I do not focus on myself
or any of the things I need to do,
instead only on working for others.

This makes me lose myself, and all my work
begins to suffer in response to that.

I think that this is something that I need
to do every now and again, for me.
To reaffirm that I am not alive
for someone else, to do what they need done.

I am alive for me, and for my goals...
But I still like to help when I'm around.
