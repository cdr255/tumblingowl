description: The apparent benefits of scheduling and keeping a calendar after two days of doing so.

When I was with Mikaela I was struck by her
ability to keep herself locked in
to her schedule. It made me start to think.

How many hours am I wasting where
I could have done much more had I just planned
my day a little more? I've never tried
to keep a tight hold on the reigns of life.
Instead, I kept myself open to change-
the cost of which is productivity.

So now I have decided I will change.

The last two days have been very unlike
what I thought it might be. I fully thought
that I would not like being tied to plans
for each moment in time. Instead, I've found
myself quite proud of what I do each day.
And it has not been easy, I should add.

The first day of this change was very good:
I planned things out, and achieved everything
I'd hoped to do that day. It was a great
experience for me. I could do this.

But then, the second day, I hit some snags.

The first was life: things got out of my hands
for much of the day time. No big deal,
I just would change my plans, or so I thought.

But then I got a headache, [as I get
so very often][headaches], and it knocked me down.
I could not muster up the drive to work
on anything for many hours, then.

But with some help from those close to me, I
was able to get up and move around.

And when I did I made a point to keep
updating my schedule as things went on.
And something great emerged when I looked back.

I'm not upset with what I did last night.
