title: Lilypond - How I Write Music
date: 29/08/2014

When I am teaching music, it's a help
to give my students something tangible- 
To serve as a reminder of the piece,
during the week of practice that's to come.

When I do not record the piece I teach,
I write it down instead, in two formats.

Now (when it comes to written music) I
prefer to use *Standard Notation*, for
it has a defined rhythmic structure and
it better represents the music played.

Alas, the standard has become instead
for people to use *Tabs* for learning songs.
To me, it is a shaky middle ground
between learning like me (that is, by ear)
and using written music to play songs.

So, I was looking for a way to write
the music one time and from it create
both tabbed and standard music from that piece.

I came across the [GNU Lilypond][lily]
project around that time. It lets me write
the music once and then I have them both
(along with others too- MIDI files
and MusicXML!) with one command.

I now compose from it exclusively,
and recommend that You all do the same.
