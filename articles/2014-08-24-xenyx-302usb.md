title: Xenyx 302USB

Today I tried my new mixing device:
The Behringer Xenyx 302U.

I'm very happy that it works so well.
Before, when I would try recording harp,
I'd run it through my full PA system
into my crappy stock laptop sound card,
and use a cheap cord to transport signals.

Needless to say it was quite noisy. And
I could not release something which sounds
so bad. So I instead wouldn't release
at all, and wait until I worked it out
so that it sounded clearer and more 'clean'.

But with the Xenyx 302 (which has
its own sound card inside) recording is
so much improved: No hiss, no noise, just nice
and clear music. This gives me confidence
enough to start recording soon, and thus
I will commit to one track every month.

When I release something I'll post it here.
