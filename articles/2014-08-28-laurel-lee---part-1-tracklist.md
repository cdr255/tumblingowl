title: Laurel Lee - Part 1 "Tracklist"
date: 28/08/2014

I've found the harp incites people to ask
a few questions more often than others.

One question I am asked quite often is,
"Do You have any albums of Your harp
music?" Until today, I would have just
said that I had a short [demo][bc-demo] from back
in twenty-twelve, though it's a bit dated.

But now, I have begun to work on my
first album. And I mean a full-length one.

I've called it *Laurel Lee*, and it will be
a ten-track long album of tunes from me
and from traditional sources as well.

For those who want the meat of it: A [link][tracklist].

I thought I would include both my own tunes
(that is, those I've composed myself), although
I also am well-rooted in old tunes:
Early Music, Irish Trad and the like.
To compromise and make it a success,
I went with a 50% split. And
I will try to make sure both are good.

My named albums like this I envision
as being a good sampling of my work.
I do not want to focus on one thing
too much; I will do that elsewhere I think.

I may switch out one tune, as well. Because
I have excluded *Bononyvi* tracks
from *Laurel Lee*... and I do not believe
a solo harp rendition of one track
will work as well as I thought it would.

I guess we will soon see. I'll let You know.
