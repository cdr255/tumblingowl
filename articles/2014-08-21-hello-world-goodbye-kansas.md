I sit here in the cold and windy room
where I have worked for the past several hours
on setting up this new website. A Blog!
So simple of a concept and yet I've learned
so much within these past four hours. Let's see...

The engine I am using is called [toto][toto].
It uses [Git][git] and lives on [heroku][heroku].
I host pictures on [Amazon S3][aws],
which lets me keep them safely in one place
while making my blog faster than it was.

This was a lot for me to learn so fast;
I was not used to anything but Git
before starting to work on this project.
I feel as though it was all time well spent,
though I admit I wish I were asleep.


[toto]: https://github.com/cloudhead/toto "Which is a DYNAMIC blogging engine, for once."
[git]: http://git-scm.com/ "I already use it for my other computer work. It is great."
[heroku]: https://www.heroku.com/ "This was the newest experience for me; It took me a while to learn all of the ins and outs."
[aws]: http://aws.amazon.com/ "This is where all of the static content for this site will live."
