title: New Year, New Life
date: 27/12/2014

As 2015 looms on the horizon, I feel a lot of change in my blood.

The past year has brought with it many times when I have been
blissfully happy... But just as many times when I have been out of my
wits with stress. Stress is probably the biggest driving force in my
life- This is something I do not want to continue, as I enter the new
year. So, like so many others, I am choosing to use the calendar's
reset as a time to reset a few of the things in my life.

Firstly, I am no longer writing this blog in an explicit and strict
meter. I found it to be very motivating and an interesting excersize,
up until the point where I ceased to post every day. After that, it
became another excuse for me to put off writing here. So, time for a
change. From now on, the restrictions on this blog are that the posts
must be strictly personal. All technical details, project
descriptions, or "work" related posts will now be on a different site:
Toft and Toddy.

Next, I am going to make it a point to do more for myself this year. I
recognize, through the words of my close friends, that I have the
tendency to act for others... often at my own expense. A lot of my
stress comes from this habit of mine, and while I do not want to stop
this entirely (helping others is a huge source of happiness for me), I
do want to reduce the amount of sacrifice I do for others. I need to
focus on my own work much more, and so I need to focus on myself.

Finally, I have a laundry list of small habits I hope to build in the
coming year, including the following:

- Daily use of a bullet journal to organize my life.
- Maintain relationships with long distance friends.
- Complete the following challenges:
    - 52 Books Challenge.
	- Song a Week Challenge.
	- 52 Week Cooking Challenge.
- Establish a workout routine, to get back in shape.
- Publish work, instead of leaving it idle forever.

With these goals (and my openness to other ones!) I hope to face 2015
with open arms... and open legs, but in a more personal sense (with
thanks to The Who for the quote).

See You all soon.
